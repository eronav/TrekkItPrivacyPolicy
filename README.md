# Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to us. It is CyberBytz's policy to respect your privacy and as such our app, TrekkIt, only reads your current location. Although the application does get this data and therefore must store it, the data is stored locally on the device and is not shared with anyone else.

Our app is completely self-serving, and therefore does not link to any external sites, nor does it use any services from your device.

Your continued use of our app will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact us.

This policy is effective as of 17 August 2023.
